# Manga Activity

A self-hostable manga tracking and reading platform built with **Cloudflare**, **React**, and **Puppeteer**.  
It aggregates chapters from various sites, offers stat tracking, and supports Discord interaction via slash commands.  
You can use the hosted version at [https://manga.kdonohoue.com](https://manga.kdonohoue.com) or deploy it yourself.

## 🧪 Running the App Locally

```sh

```

`pnpm tunnel` supports two modes:
 - Quick Start Mode: No setup — generates a random Cloudflare domain.

# For local development:
pnpm resetDbLocal
```
### 4. R2 Object Storage
